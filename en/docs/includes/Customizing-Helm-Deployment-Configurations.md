To customize configurations in the Helm deployment, you need to have the `values.yaml` file. Follow one of the steps below to download the `values.yaml` file:

1. Cloning the Kubernetes Gateway Repository

    You can clone the Kubernetes Gateway GitHub repository using the following command.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/wso2/apk.git
    ```

    This will create a local copy of the entire repository on your machine. You can then navigate to the `helm-charts` directory and locate the `values.yaml` file.

2. Downloading the `values.yaml` File

    If you prefer not to clone the whole repository, you can directly download the `values.yaml` file from the repository's URL [https://github.com/wso2/apk/blob/main/helm-charts/values.yaml](https://github.com/wso2/apk/blob/main/helm-charts/values.yaml).
