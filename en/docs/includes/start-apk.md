Follow the instructions below to deploy Kubernetes Gateway in the Kubernetes cluster.

### Install Kubernetes Gateway

1. Create a new helm repository with the latest Kubernetes Gateway release using the following command. Letâ€™s consider the ```<repository-name>``` as ```wso2apk``` for this guide.

    ```console
    helm repo add wso2apk https://github.com/wso2/apk/releases/download/1.3.0-beta
    ```

2. Execute the following command to update the helm repositories.

    ```console
    helm repo update
    ```
   
3. Install the Kubernetes Gateway components and start WSO2 Kubernetes Gateway. Consider ```apk``` as the ```<chart-name>``` for this guide. As the ```--version``` of this command, use the version of the release you used in point 1 above. It will take a few minutes for the deployment to complete.

=== "Command"
    ```
    helm install apk wso2apk/apk-helm --version 1.3.0-beta
    ```

=== "Format"
    ```
    helm install <chart-name> <repository-name>/apk-helm --version <version-of-APK>
    ```

    !!! Important
        Except for the `gateway-apim-admission` and `gateway-apim-admission-patch` (which will run as soon as Kubernetes Gateway is installed and then complete), all other pods should transition to the running state. If they have not, please refer the <a href="../../about-apk/FAQs/#4-why-are-pods-not-transitioning-to-the-running-state-for-a-long-time" target="_blank">FAQs</a> to troubleshoot the problem.
