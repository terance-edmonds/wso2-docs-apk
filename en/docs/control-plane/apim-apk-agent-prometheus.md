## Configuring Prometheus for Kubernetes Gateway Agent

This document contains the steps to configure Prometheus for the Kubernetes Gateway Agent. 

To enable metrics, simply make the metrics.enabled field true under the helm-charts/values.yaml file as shown.

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: true
```

### Configuring Prometheus Server

1. Incorporate a configuration similar to the following in your prometheus.yml file. Based on your method of deploying Prometheus, the following can be added as a ConfigMap.
   
```yaml
prometheus.yml: |
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'apim-apk-agent'
        kubernetes_sd_configs:
          - role: pod
            namespaces: # if you wish to filter your components by namespace as well
              names:
                - 'apk'
        relabel_configs:
          - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]
            regex: '.*apim-apk-agent.*'
            action: keep
          - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_number]
            regex: '18006' # Replace with the appropriate port number
            action: keep
          - target_label: __metrics_path__
            replacement: /metrics   # the metrics path.
          - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_id, __meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_number]
            replacement: '$1/$2'
            target_label: instance
```

!!! Note
    Configure the prometheus service with the required level of permissions on Kubernetes.

### Using the APIM APK Grafana Dashboard

* The Grafana dashboard for the APIM APK Agent can be downloaded from [here.](../assets/files/prometheus/APIMAPKAgentGrafana.json)
* Import the dashboards to Grafana.
* Change the Prometheus data source, job name and other dashboard variables as required.
* The following is a preview of the APIM APK Agent Grafana dashboard.
