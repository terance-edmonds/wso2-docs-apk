# Weighted Routing

Weighted Routing is an important feature in API management that enables traffic distribution across multiple backend endpoints based on custom-defined weights. This allows API providers to control the proportion of requests directed to each endpoint, ensuring efficient resource utilization and optimized system performance. By strategically directing traffic, Weighted Routing supports advanced deployment strategies like rolling updates and A/B testing, minimizing downtime and reducing deployment risks.

You can configure weighted routing in either of the following ways:

1. [Via REST API (using the APK-Conf file)](../weighted-routing-via-rest-api){:target="_blank"}.
2. [Via CRs](../weighted-routing-via-crs){:target="_blank"}.
